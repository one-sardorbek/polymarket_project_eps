        "description": "The National Football League Draft, also called the NFL Draft or (officially) the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event which serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. Each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first and the Super Bowl champion is last. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade its position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its position in the draft. The first draft was held in 1936, and has been held every year since.\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft, the 87th edition of the National Football League's annual draft, is scheduled to be held April 28\u201330, 2022, at Caesars Forum on the Las Vegas Strip, in Paradise, Nevada.",

    "description": "On Monday, June 27, 2022, Bloomberg News reported that the crypto exchange FTX was considering acquiring the trading app Robinhood. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that FTX had been discussing a takeover plan internally, however no offer had yet been made to Robinhood. As of June 27, Sam Bankman-Fried (CEO of FTX) denies the report and Robinhood has not commented.\n\nThis is a market on whether Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) announces it will be acquired by FTX, or FTX announces it will acquire Robinhood Markets, Inc. by September 20, 2022. \n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, only announcements from Robinhood or FTX that one or the other or both are agreeing to an acquisition or merger will be sufficient to resolve this market to \u201cYes\u201d. If Robinhood announces by September 20, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET that it will be acquired by FTX, or acquired by or merged with any entity controlled by FTX, it will be sufficient to resolve this market to \u201cYes\u201d regardless of whether that acquisition or merger takes place within or outside of the timeframe of this market. If FTX, or any entity controlled by FTX, announces by September 20, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET that it will acquire or merge with Robinhood, it will be sufficient to resolve this market to \"Yes\" regardless of whether that acquisition or merger takes place within or outside of the timeframe of this market. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf Robinhood or FTX announces it will no longer agree to the terms of its initial agreement or announcement after previously announcing an agreement to an acquisition of Robinhood by FTX, or an acquisition of Robinhood by or merger of Robinhood with any entity controlled by FTX, it will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" solely based on whether an initial announcement is made that Robinhood will be acquired by FTX, or acquired by or merged with any entity controlled by FTX.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from Robinhood and FTX (e.g. https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp, https://twitter.com/FTX_Official, https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/sections/4414757143188-Announcements, https://blog.robinhood.com/, etc.); however, other credible reporting may be used to resolve this market. \n",

        "title": "Will an FTX acquisition of Robinhood be announced by September 20?",
        "description": "On Monday, June 27, 2022, Bloomberg News reported that the crypto exchange FTX was considering acquiring the trading app Robinhood. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that FTX had been discussing a takeover plan internally, however no offer had yet been made to Robinhood. As of June 27, Sam Bankman-Fried (CEO of FTX) denies the report and Robinhood has not commented.\n\nThis is a market on whether Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) announces it will be acquired by FTX, or FTX announces it will acquire Robinhood Markets, Inc. by September 20, 2022. \n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, only announcements from Robinhood or FTX that one or the other or both are agreeing to an acquisition or merger will be sufficient to resolve this market to \u201cYes\u201d. If Robinhood announces by September 20, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET that it will be acquired by FTX, or acquired by or merged with any entity controlled by FTX, it will be sufficient to resolve this market to \u201cYes\u201d regardless of whether that acquisition or merger takes place within or outside of the timeframe of this market. If FTX, or any entity controlled by FTX, announces by September 20, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET that it will acquire or merge with Robinhood, it will be sufficient to resolve this market to \"Yes\" regardless of whether that acquisition or merger takes place within or outside of the timeframe of this market. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf Robinhood or FTX announces it will no longer agree to the terms of its initial agreement or announcement after previously announcing an agreement to an acquisition of Robinhood by FTX, or an acquisition of Robinhood by or merger of Robinhood with any entity controlled by FTX, it will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" solely based on whether an initial announcement is made that Robinhood will be acquired by FTX, or acquired by or merged with any entity controlled by FTX.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from Robinhood and FTX (e.g. https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp, https://twitter.com/FTX_Official, https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/sections/4414757143188-Announcements, https://blog.robinhood.com/, etc.); however, other credible reporting may be used to resolve this market. \n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nOnly official publicly issued communications from OpenAI will count towards this market's resolution. Unofficial statements or interviews by board members or employees, including Sam Altman, will not suffice for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nIf it is announced that GPT-5 is completed before this market's timeframe begins, this market may immediately resolve to \"No\". Otherwise, it may not resolve to \"No\" until its end time has passed and the completion of GPT-5 has not been announced.\n\nGPT-5 refers to a product that is explicitly named GPT-5, or is a successor to GPT-4 in the way that GPT-4 was a successor to GPT-3. GPT-4.5 or such products will not count for this market's resolution.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official OpenAI communications from its website https://openai.com/.",
