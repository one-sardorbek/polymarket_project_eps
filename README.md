First I got the markets related to EPS earnings and saved them to json file (as json file is easier to load and use in the following code)

Then I loaded market infos, got the trades' and traders' data. Then I saved them to csv file

There are built in limits. User can change them based on preferences

All neccesary parts are commented but please make sure that the filters match your need before running the code or getting the data.
